              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 20px;">
                I normally don’t write reviews or letters of praise for contractors that I’ve had do work for me because
                frankly their
                quality of work and price just doesn’t deserve it, but I’m writing this to help anyone out there that is
                looking for a
                contractor and wants the highest quality craftsmanship along with the most reasonable pricing that I’ve
                found. Joe Smith
                of Pro 1 Contracting offers both. He recently installed new counter tops and back splashes throughout my
                kitchen and he
                personally designed and constructed a beautiful deck around my above ground pool. His attention to detail is
                impeccable.
                His work and craftsmanship brings to mind many of the things that I thought had been lost by contractors
                over the past
                four or five decades. Joe takes real pride in his work and when he was finished for the day he left the work
                areas clean
                and totally squared away. He ensures his customers are happy and satisfied, no matter what the project, big
                or small. If
                you want the job done right the first time, by someone with true integrity, a great work ethic that also
                takes pride in
                what they do, Joe Smith of Pro 1 Contracting is the right choice for you. I wrote this because I stand
                behind Pro One
                Contracting, just like he stands behind his work. What a great job.

              <h5 class="card-title">Kitchen Remodel</h5>
              <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 20px;">I never tend to review anyone or give advice to anyone looking for help. When I have done
                that in the past it never
                seems to work out. I wanted to tell people that because I wanted them to know just how blown away I am with
                joe smith.
                He totally remodeled my kitchen and moved a door to another place in the house. I cannot tell you how lucky
                you would be
                using his talents and skill at your next remodeling job. I normally look at these reviews to get a good feel
                of what the
                contractor has to offer. I hope you read mine and understand how good and fair joe has been with my wife and
                I through
                this process. I have 7 kids and it worked out easily with him working around us and getting the job done.
    
                I want to thank him again for a wonderful job and would hope this helps someone looking for the perfect guy
                to do their
                remodeling job.</p>
