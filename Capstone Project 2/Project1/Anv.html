      <!-- Apology message -->
      <p class="apology">I am sorry I was not better at this. I hate CSS but because I may not have taken it super cereal with everything going for the move-plan on the first time around with studying, but I am going to try to get back to a routine where I can gain a better understanding of the material. I started to work on this project to give me something independent to do to show myself what I can do. I know that it has not been easy being married to me at times, but I hope you do know, in spite of everything that may or may not have happened over the last 6 months, I would not change a thing. I just want us to be more supportive and positive with each other. I think it will have a great impact.</p>
